# REGEX DATA EXTRACTION

Welcome to the **Regex Data Extraction** project! This project uses Python and powerful Regular Expressions to extract meaningful information from large bodies of text, such as:

-  Email addresses  
-  URLs  
-  Phone numbers (including country codes)  
-  Credit card numbers  
-  Hashtags
